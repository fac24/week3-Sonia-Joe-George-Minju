# Project report


## Introduction

### What are you building?
A plant-based milk-themed web app that authenticates users and stores user-specific data in a PostgreSQL database.


### Why are you building it?
To practice all the concepts that we leart so far including Servers, Databases with a focus on Authentication.


## Project scope


### What are you not building? (stretch goals that were discarded?)
- log out feature(need to delete sid in cookie)
- another data table for base_ingredients 
- individual user page
- A "finished" app!

### How did you decide what features were important?

By thinking about what features would help us achieve the learning outcomes we were most interested in.


## Project plan

<!--

Joe says: this is a project report, so I suppose in this section we're supposed to present the project plan that we *did* (theoretically!) make at the start of the project, not make up a new one now :)

-->

### How did you delegate work?

- When/if possible, split into pairs to focus on our roles a bit more (e.g. QA, UX).


## Project learnings:

### Did your team work effectively?

Yes. We split into pairs to work on different features. We came together to debug, whenever it was needed. 

### What would you do differently next time?



## Requirement analysis:

### How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?
- We tried to validate user input in the browser and present error messages accessibly.
- Use semantic html 


# Recommendations and conclusions:

### What features would you prioritise to build next?


- Catching error with all routes(possiblities).
- Logout page

### Was the project a success?

- It was successful to practice on authentication part.
- We have an MVP.
